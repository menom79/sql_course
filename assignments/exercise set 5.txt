Query 1
-- Create a new table called SALARIES with the following columns:
salaryID (primary key)
salary (the amount of salary described with two decimals)

Create table SALARIES
(
SalaryID INT not null,
Salary decimal(10,2),
Primary key (salaryID)
);

Query 2
-- Create a connection between SALARIES and EMPS tables (Tip: First think what column you 
should bring from EMPS table and then create a new column for it). Use the following options 
in foreign key definition:

UPDATE CASCADE
DELETE NO ACTION

Alter table salaries
Add column EMPNUM decimal(3,0);

ALTER TABLE salaries
ADD FOREIGN KEY (empnum) REFERENCES emps(empnum) on update cascade on delete no action;

Query 3
-- Add a new column called fromdate. The current date should be added automatically for this 
column when new data is inserted.

Alter table salaries
Add column fromdate date default current_timestamp;

Query 4
-- Add automatic counter for salaryID column so that this field value will be automatically 
generated each time a new data is inserted.

Alter table salaries 
modify SalaryID INT not null auto_increment;

Query 5
-- Create input validation check with TRIGGER so that salaries exceeding 10000 euros cannot 
be inserted to the table.

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER check_salary BEFORE INSERT ON salaries
FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        IF NEW.salary > 10000
            THEN SET NEW.salary = null;
        END if;
    END $$

Query 6
-- Modify previously created input validation so that inserted value must also be even 
(num % 2 = 0). Important: Trigger cannot be modified so you will need to drop the existing 
trigger and create a new one.

DELIMITER $$
